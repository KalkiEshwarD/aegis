# Aegis Application Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the findings of a comprehensive security audit of the Aegis file vault application. The audit covered the Go backend, React frontend, configuration files, database migrations, middleware, services, and shared validation files. A total of 15 security issues were identified across all severity levels.

**Issue Summary by Severity:**
- **Critical**: 4 issues
- **High**: 6 issues
- **Medium**: 3 issues
- **Low**: 2 issues

## Critical Issues

### 1. Exposed Secrets in Version Control
**Affected Files:** `aegis/.env`
**Description:** The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials (database passwords, MinIO keys, JWT secrets) is not included in `.gitignore` and appears to be committed to version control. This exposes production secrets to anyone with repository access.
**Recommendation:** Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately. Rotate all exposed secrets. Use environment-specific secret management systems.

### 2. Default Administrative Credentials
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Description:** The initial database migration creates a default admin user with username 'admin@aegis.local' and password 'password' (bcrypt hash). This provides unauthorized administrative access if not changed.
**Recommendation:** Remove default admin user creation from migrations. Require secure admin setup during initial deployment.

### 3. Weak JWT Secret Configuration
**Affected Files:** `aegis/.env`, `aegis/.env.example`
**Description:** The JWT_SECRET is set to a placeholder value that doesn't meet minimum length requirements (32 characters). The application validates this but the example file shows an insecure default.
**Recommendation:** Generate cryptographically secure random keys of at least 256 bits (32 bytes) for JWT secrets. Update examples to show proper key generation.

### 4. Encryption Keys Exposed in URLs
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/graph/schema.resolvers.go:859`
**Description:** In the `AccessSharedFile` resolver, decrypted file encryption keys are appended to download URLs as query parameters. This exposes sensitive cryptographic material in URLs, which may be logged by web servers, browsers, and network devices.
**Recommendation:** Use secure methods to transmit encryption keys, such as encrypted cookies or secure HTTP headers. Avoid placing sensitive data in URLs.

## High Issues

### 5. Password Exposure in Download URLs
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go:305`
**Description:** Share access passwords are included in download URLs as query parameters. This exposes passwords in server logs, browser history, and referrer headers.
**Recommendation:** Use POST requests or secure headers to transmit passwords instead of URL parameters.

### 6. Insecure MinIO Configuration
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go:90`
**Description:** MinIO client is configured with `Secure: false` for local development, but this setting may persist in production deployments, transmitting data unencrypted over HTTP.
**Recommendation:** Make SSL/TLS configuration environment-dependent. Enforce HTTPS for production MinIO connections.

### 7. Excessive Debug Logging in Production
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/internal/middleware/auth.go`, `aegis/backend/graph/schema.resolvers.go`
**Description:** Extensive debug logging is present throughout the codebase, including sensitive information like user authentication details and file operations. This could leak information in production logs.
**Recommendation:** Implement log levels and disable debug logging in production environments.

### 8. Missing CSRF Protection
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go`
**Description:** No CSRF protection is implemented for GraphQL mutations or REST endpoints, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations, especially for file uploads and deletions.

### 9. Insecure Template Path Resolution
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go:258`
**Description:** Template paths use relative paths with ".." which could potentially allow path traversal attacks if user input influences path construction.
**Recommendation:** Use absolute paths or properly validate/sanitize any user-influenced path components.

### 10. Missing Rate Limiting for Sensitive Operations
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/internal/middleware/rate_limit.go`
**Description:** Rate limiting is applied globally but may not adequately protect sensitive operations like password attempts or file sharing access.
**Recommendation:** Implement operation-specific rate limiting, especially for authentication and file access attempts.

## Medium Issues

### 11. Oversized Source File
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/graph/schema.resolvers.go` (1415 lines)
**Description:** The GraphQL resolver file exceeds 500 lines, indicating potential monolithic architecture that could make maintenance and security reviews difficult.
**Recommendation:** Refactor into smaller, focused modules. Consider separating concerns into different files based on functionality.

### 12. Overly Permissive CORS Configuration
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go:165-178`
**Description:** CORS configuration allows all origins when set to "*" and uses credentials, potentially enabling cross-origin attacks.
**Recommendation:** Restrict CORS origins to specific trusted domains. Avoid wildcard origins in production.

### 13. Lack of Token Refresh Mechanism
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/internal/services/auth_service.go`
**Description:** JWT tokens have a fixed 24-hour expiration with no refresh mechanism, requiring frequent re-authentication.
**Recommendation:** Implement token refresh functionality to improve user experience while maintaining security.

## Low Issues

### 14. Missing HSTS Headers for HTTP
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/internal/middleware/security.go:30-33`
**Description:** HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are only set when TLS is detected, leaving HTTP connections unprotected.
**Recommendation:** Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and enforce HSTS headers.

### 15. Potential Path Traversal in Template Loading
**Affected Files:** `aegis/backend/cmd/main.go:258`
**Description:** Template loading uses "../templates/" which could be vulnerable to path traversal if the working directory is compromised.
**Recommendation:** Use secure path resolution methods and validate template paths.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` and rotate all exposed secrets
2. Remove default admin credentials from database migrations
3. Implement proper key transmission for file encryption
4. Add CSRF protection to state-changing endpoints

### Security Enhancements
1. Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
2. Add security headers for all endpoints
3. Implement proper session management
4. Add security monitoring and alerting
5. Conduct regular security audits and dependency updates

### Architecture Improvements
1. Refactor oversized files into modular components
2. Implement proper error handling without information leakage
3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Compliance Considerations

The application should be reviewed against relevant security standards:
- OWASP Top 10
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry-specific regulations (if applicable)

## Conclusion

While the application demonstrates good cryptographic practices and basic security measures, several critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention. The exposed secrets and weak default configurations pose the most significant risks. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the application's security posture.
