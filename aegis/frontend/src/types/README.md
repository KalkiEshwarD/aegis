# Types

This directory contains the TypeScript type definitions for the Aegis frontend.

## File

*   `index.ts`: This file defines all the TypeScript interfaces and types that are used throughout the application. This includes types for users, files, folders, rooms, and API responses.

## Functionality

By defining all the types in a central location, the application can ensure type safety and consistency across all its components and services. This makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.

The types in this file are used to define the shape of the data that is passed between components, returned from hooks, and exchanged with the backend API.
