# Shared

This directory contains files and utilities that are shared across different parts of the Aegis frontend application.

## Directory Structure

*   `components/`: This directory contains shared, reusable React components that are used in multiple places throughout the application.
*   `errors/`: This directory likely contains shared error handling utilities or definitions, although it appears to be empty.
*   `utils/`: This directory contains shared utility functions that can be used by any component or hook in the application.

## Functionality

This directory is intended to hold code that is not specific to any single feature or component, but is instead used globally. By centralizing shared code in this directory, we can avoid code duplication and improve the overall maintainability of the application.
