# Shared Components

This directory contains shared, reusable React components that are used in multiple places throughout the application.

## Files

*   `ConfirmationDialog.tsx`: A dialog component that prompts the user for confirmation before performing an action. It can be customized with a title, message, and confirmation button text.
*   `index.ts`: This file exports all the components from this directory, making it easier to import them elsewhere in the application.
*   `SharePasswordDialog.tsx`: A dialog component that prompts the user to enter a password to access a shared file.
