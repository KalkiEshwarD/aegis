# GraphQL

This directory contains the GraphQL implementation for the Aegis backend.

## Directory Structure

*   `generated/`: This directory contains the code automatically generated by `gqlgen` from the GraphQL schema. It should not be manually edited.
*   `model/`: This directory contains the Go models that correspond to the types in the GraphQL schema.
*   `resolver.go`: This file is the root resolver, which is used for dependency injection. It holds references to the services required by the GraphQL resolvers.
*   `schema.graphql`: This is the main GraphQL schema file. It defines all the queries, mutations, and types for the API.
*   `schema.resolvers.go`: This file contains the implementation of the resolvers defined in the `schema.graphql` file. It's where the business logic is connected to the GraphQL API.

## Functionality

This directory is the heart of the backend's API. It uses the `gqlgen` library to build a type-safe GraphQL server.

*   **`schema.graphql`**: Defines the API contract, including all available operations and data structures.
*   **`resolver.go` and `schema.resolvers.go`**: Implement the logic for each GraphQL operation, fetching data from services and returning it to the client.
*   **`generated/` and `model/`**: These directories contain the boilerplate code that connects the schema to the Go implementation, which is automatically generated by `gqlgen`.
