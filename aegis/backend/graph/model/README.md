# GraphQL Models

This directory contains the Go struct definitions that are generated by `gqlgen` to correspond to the types defined in the GraphQL schema.

## File

*   `models_gen.go`: This file contains all the Go structs that are used as input and output types for the GraphQL resolvers. These structs are generated based on the `schema.graphql` file.

**Do not edit this file manually.**

Any changes made here will be overwritten the next time the `gqlgen` tool is run. If you need to modify these models, you should update the `schema.graphql` file and then regenerate the code.
